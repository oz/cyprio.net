title: "I'm not dead, yet."

The advantages to being in Mexico are quite many, and I won't bother counting,
or comparing to whatever other country you live in. I'm reaaally good where I
am now, and sad that I shall return back to France "soon".

However, one major drawback is that I get an incredible amount of mails from
friends (and ex-friends too... wtf go away!) trying to get in touch, and
deserving a response. So, if I'm slow responding to your mail or IRC queries,
I'm really sorry.

However, I also realized how little mails and phone calls I got from my family
since they're now flooding my inbox quasi-daily. I still have a handy macro in
mutt that deletes any mail bigger than 1MB, which helps. :)

... but in the end, playing dead with your mother/father is quite a nasty
thing to do, or is it?
