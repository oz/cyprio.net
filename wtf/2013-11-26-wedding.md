title: "Wedding"
---

So, the story is I'm getting married in January next year, the 11th to be
precise.

I'm learning the whole "we" everywhere thing, but the truth is _we_ are not so
fond of doing everything together. Rather we're more like practical human
beings with a good track-record of not killing each other, and a natural taste
for having people enjoy themselves around us. Obviously, the girl is awesome,
talented, blah blah blah... I haven't written this speech yet. :)

This also means we're having a _little_ party with around 150 persons at the
latest head-count, and we're also trying not to become too much of a skinflint
with the cost of it all.

Meanwhile, I'll just ignore the dying NAS disks, the VPS bills piling here and
there, and other rather useless geeky stuff. Yes, I will. I'm positive I'm not
paying attention to all of this stuff, and focusing purely on getting cute
flowers and good liquor to every table.
