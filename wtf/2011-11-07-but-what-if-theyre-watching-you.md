title: but what if they're watching you?

I'm wondering who will have total control over my next phone: Apple or Google?
How can we call these _smart_ phones when you only choose which vendor will
transform _your_ hardware in an extension of your credit-card? That's mass-
market at work: where everyone care about the number of cores or the size of
the screen.

Anyway, there's only so much time a geek can cling to his
[N900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900) ; the N9 is running a dead OS
supposedly superseded by a "[tizen project](https://www.tizen.org/)", which is
still vapor-ware (hopefully some information will escape on this from the next
LinuxCon in Brazil).

I'm feeling quite disappointed by the phones out there: they're all the same.
Don't start me on tablets. :)
