title: "A few things on the Corona music fest in Oaxaca"
---

This week-end I was at a beer-sponsored concert in Oaxaca with big names like
[Molotov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_\(band\)),
[Fobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fobia), [Sussie
4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussie_4), etc. If you never heard of them,
don't worry too much, I hadn't either: I have tons of work to know more this
place... That being said it was the first time I went to a big concert in
Mexico so I have to admit I was surprised by a few things.

The first is being told I couldn't get in with a messenger bag (outdoor
concert: clothes), which was easily solved by the security-guy checking it
really thoroughly until he took away a ball-point pen forgotten in there... I
wonder if he seriously thought I could kill someone with a pen. Well that's
not really mexican, I've had my fair-share of zealous checks in Europe too.

The second weird thing for me is the habit _a few_ mexicans have of throwing
all kind of stuff in the air to express their feelings. Best case: they start
throwing their beers. Worst case: one wasted guy's too lazy to walk to the
bathroom ; yummy. In the end, I was quite pleased I could get in with a
hoodie. :p
