**In Heaven.**

You're mysterious, picky, and a bit aloof. Some people say you have a very
cheery personality, but it's hard to say because you mask your emotions behind
dark pretenses. You enjoy watching obscure movies and going to plays, but by
the end of the day you're usually too wound-up by the ironies of your life to
relax.

[Which Pixies song are you?](http://www.eyeofdog.com/QuizPixies.html)

Ce qui est marrant avec ces tests, c'est que finalement on peut les amener où
on veut. Mais test à la con ou pas, je suis une chanson des Pixies. Et toc.
