title: "outside in"

What's up? Well, on my side of this blog not much. 2010 is finally dying, and
I've been considering doing a few silly things to celebrate, like selling some
of my stuff (in order to make some room for myself). Let's say it's a
resolution for 2011. For example, I do not depend on my TV to get news, or...
watch TV. Let's sell the stupid thing already. On the other hand, I hate new-
year's resolutions, so let's call it a challenge. The latter is much more
likely to make my lazy ass do it.

Since I'm talking about my place, I have to admit that I need to fill my
fridge, since he's been almost empty since I got back from the traditional
family diners of December (it's been almost a week). However, I keep
discovering (surprise!) more excuses to bury my stupid-self under piles of
work... so empty the fridge remains.

The good news, is that I'm spending 3 months in Mexico starting in February
2011. I'm still not sure if it's a great idea, since the place is damn far.
But I'm quite sure, on the other hand, that I have to get away from my little
world for a while, to check out what's happening somewhere else. To put it
simply, I'm bored: I need a bigger horizon, or at the very least: distraction.

Let's see how tele-commuting works out for me. :)
