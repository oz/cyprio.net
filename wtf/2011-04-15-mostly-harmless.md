title: "Mostly Harmless"

I decided I should try to post a few things more geek-oriented on a "tech"
blog. However, this was never the real intent of this place (despite some rare
apparitions). This is when I remembered that I have had a [posterous
account](http://ephoz.posterous.com/) for quite some time.

It is finally put to use at <http://ephoz.posterous.com>. I'll start very
modestly with a "stupid ruby tip", and try to write interesting stuff there on
ruby, or nodejs, or nosql, and the other varieties of subjects I bizarrely
enjoy a lot.

Hope this (will) help (someone).
