title: "once upon a time, me myself and I..."

_the me that you know is now made up of wires  
and even when i'm right with you i'm so far away  
i can try to get away but i've strapped myself in  
i can try to scratch away the sound in my ears  
i can see it killing away all my bad parts  
i don't want to listen but it's all too clear_

in the becoming - NIN
