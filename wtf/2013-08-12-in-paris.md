title: In Paris...
---

I'll be in Paris for two weeks. I'm staying at a friends' flat, feeding their
cat while they're away enjoying the southern shores and sun. Paris is so calm
in those days, just like the office. It feels good, better than last time I
went here in May because it's easier to concentrate and I feel less
overwhelmed by all the (new) faces I see. I think this near-emptiness borders
on the apathetic side though, but maybe it's just me trying to feel sad for
some reason.

Also, I've been having the worse can of stupid dreams lately. I'd rather have
weird Freudian dreams rather than those Hollywood blockbusters with happy
ends.
