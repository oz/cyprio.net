> Around 2004, we decided to build a parallel implementation of the GHC
runtime system for running on shared memory multiprocessors, something that
had not been done before. This was just before the multicore revolution.
Multiprocessor machines were fairly common, but multicores were still around
the corner. Again, I'd like to think the decision to tackle parallelism at
this point was enlightened foresight, but it had more to do with the fact that
building a shared-memory parallel implementation was an interesting research
problem and sounded like fun.

From the preface of Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell. Sounds
like fun. :)
