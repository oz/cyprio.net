title: "Committed to Life"
---

_I'll be honest with you:  
I hate war in all it's forms-  
Physical, Psychological, Spiritual... Emotional... Environmental  
I hate war...  
And I hate having to struggle - I honestly do  
because I wish I had been into a world where it was  
unnecessary.  
This context of struggle and being a warrior and being a  
struggler  
has been forced on me by oppression.  
Otherwise I would be a sculptor, or a gardener,  
carpenter - you know, I would be free to be so much more...

I guess part of me or a part of who I am, a part of what I do  
is being a warrior - a reluctant warrior, a reluctant struggler  
But... I do it because I'm committed to life  
We can't avoid it, we can't run away from it  
Because to do that is to be... cowardice-  
to do that is to be subservient... to devils, subservient to  
evil and so that the only way to live on this planet  
With any human dignity at the moment is to struggle._
