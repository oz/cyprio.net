Deactivated my Facebook account today. Got bored, since it is only a source of
noise with little valuable information. It is also redundant with other means
of communication with my friends, but really the useless noise's the most
annoying thing, I don't have much time to waste at the moment. :)

No, I don't care if you **liked** another video on Youtube: were it _that_
good, you'd find another way to contact me anyway. I'd also argue that talking
around beers (or coffees!) is better than chat windows, no?
