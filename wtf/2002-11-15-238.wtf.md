title: "The Road Not Taken"
---

_I hitchhiked home from the Temple that night  
some thirty years ago now  
and this old, fat guy  
who picked me up  
told me I could have a job  
that would take me around the world  
if we could sleep together the whole time.  
I stayed hip through the proposition, though,  
I said it would be something new for me  
(which was actually true at the time),  
and I made him let me off at the corner  
in Glencoe, Illinois.  
.......  
If he had been any younger,  
or even had average looks,  
I would have said yes,  
Because I remember that night,  
I was so tired of being alone  
that suicide felt like a good thing,  
even if it was the slow kind.

Anyway, I took another road  
and ended up married, with children.  
And there was no pool of blood  
in the morning papers.  
I learned to bleed slowly little by little,  
without making a mess.
