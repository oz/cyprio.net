Checking a rather old Leica manual for the M6 (emphasis mine).

> However, if a landscape scene containing many white clouds is photographed
using a wide-angle lens or **if the exposure meter is influenced by very
bright lamps in a Bavarian beer tent**, for example, the camera should be
turned towards an area containing no particular bright or dark details

I'm starting to like these guys. :)
