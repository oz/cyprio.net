> **Idiot**, n. A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in
human affairs has always been dominant and controlling. The Idiot's activity
is not confined to any special field of thought or action, but "pervades and
regulates the whole." He has the last word in everything; his decision is
unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the
limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line.

In _The Devil's Dictionary_ by Ambrose Bierce.
