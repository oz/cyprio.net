title: "cleanup"
---

That's almost a month without an update. Yeah I know... but what can I say,
I'm a lazy cow. The thing that may or may not bother you (at least it bothers
me), is that I have quite a few "writings" lingering in a folder somewhere. So
there may or may not be hope for this place yet. I still have plans to move
back to Mexico for a few months more, the easiness of which highly depends on
my relation with $work.

We'll see how that part goes, meanwhile I'm still selling a few things I don't
plan to use, or haven't been using for a while : I call this "the great
cleanup". I'd rather give or sale stuff since I'm always baffled by all the
genuinely good things people are trashing in my street from tables, ovens, to
LCD screens... I don't get it, but I guess it's a form of gift too.
