title: Kisses from Oaxaca
---

It's been 6 days since I took off from France... What can I say about Mexico?
It's great. In some ways it is like I thought it would be, with a good deal of
surprises, and discoveries too. I don't like very much what I have seen of
Mexico City, although I did not spend an awful lot of time there, and will be
staying around [Oaxaca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca,_Oaxaca) a lot
more... Oaxaca's definitely my cup of tea. My spanish's still bad but
improving. I've already tasted a few types of mezcals from here and there,
learned that the tourist season is expected soon, and and whole lot of other
stuff I don't want to explain for lack of time or motivation to write
everything down here. :)

When I'm less lazy I'll post a bunch of photos on a
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) log for those who want them. I'll keep you
posted on that, don't worry.

I guess it's already "tomorrow" in Paris, so I'll let you to your pillows.
Hopefully we'll meet again in may. ;)
