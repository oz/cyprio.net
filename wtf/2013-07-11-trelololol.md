title: Trelololol

I'm currently in the middle of planning holidays next month in Europe. We'll
be landing in Madrid in august for roughly a month and a half (yay
[Baruco](http://baruco.org)!). We plan to go to Barcelona, Venice, Paris, and
a few other places too. :)

This gave me the opportunity to try [Trello](https://www.trello.com) to get a
better overview of the whole trip: places to go, friends to visit, etc. As
Kanban boards go, Trello's default lists of "todo", "doing", and "done" works
well for the tickets and reservation part. I need to buy these tickets, and
book this hotel... But once, every reservation ends in the "done" list, you're
left with a huge "todo" full of ideas to try while in one place or another.
Using labels helps filtering, but it's still a mess.

The solution I tried is obviously more boards! I'm not visiting too many
places, which means I can use a second board to have one list per place or
occasion, and cram more cards there. 'works like a charm.

In the end, Trello's nice to have when I'm using a hotel/airport's wifi. But I
haven't had a data plan for years, which means I have no access to my data
(save for what's cached on my phone) when on the go. I still carry a Moleskine
to copy important stuff in case Internet is off limit _or_ phone's out of
batteries, or lost whatever. Paper's best, but I'd still like some way to tell
the Trello app to sync *everything* offline (hint: including PDF attachments
that double as plane tickets) like [Evernote](http://evernote.com) does so
well...
