title: Because we all love Windows

Here's the problem that ends up killing company after company. All successful
software companies had, as their dominant personality, a leader who nurtured
programmers. But no company can keep such a leader forever. Either he cashes
out, or he brings in management types who end up driving him out, or he
changes and becomes a management type himself. One way or another, marketers
get control. But...control of what? Instead of finding assembly lines of
productive workers, they quickly discover that their product is produced by
utterly unpredictable, uncooperative, disobedient, and worst of all,
unattractive people who resist all attempts at management. Put them on a time
clock, dress them in suits, and they become sullen and start sabotaging the
product. Worst of all, you can sense that they are making fun of you with
every word they say.  

I found some of
[this](http://www.netjeff.com/humor/item.cgi?file=DeveloperBees) to be true
which is a little odd for a "humorous" rant written 15 years ago. And about
that Windows thing, in march 1995 a huge part of the programming work happened
on Microsoft's OS-es. At least, we changed _that_. :)
