title: Letter
---

At [work] we usually run an IRC bot on most of our channels: it tells us about
stupid facts, the weather, quotes our most shameful bits ruthlessly, fetches
tweets, or reacts to other things like Trac ticket numbers, or Trello cards,
etc.

To be honest, I have been maintaining the thing for too long, and a complete
overhaul is long overdue: the code is based on [Cinch] (which is an awesome
project), but has been grafted too many intertwined features that would be
better released as separate open-source gems (ACLs, simple storage, operating
hours, etc.). Well, maybe this is material for another occasion.


# Making Mondays suck a little less

Yet, one of the most useful feature is a simple link logger: every now and
then, someone mentions that [totally original cat picture][cat], and we log
that. Better, when a developer is slacking (a little slack is good, shut up) on
Reddit or Slacker News, they may post some bits on IRC too. It can look like
that:

> SlackerKid: folks! Stop what you're doing now! Check that new node.js module
> https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix #node #bittorrent

Or even:

> TrollerMan: I can't believe they released #golang without proper generics
> http://golang.org #lulz.

Yes, on some IRC channels, trolling is also common. All those links, and their
tags, end up on a Delicious[^1] [account][delicious]. However we can not be
monitoring IRC all day long (some of us *are* a little busy, right?), so things
can easily get lost. And this is how [DeliciousLetter] was born: a few lines of
Ruby in a cronjob, that grabs all those links, masticates them for a while, and
spits out an HTML summary of our week.

Hand-curated contents, without pushy algorithms, delivered to a nearby inbox on
Monday mornings: we think it goes nicely with a coffee.


# Pepito Rumble

[Rails Rumble] is a nice competition, and promotion operation, for the [Ruby on
Rails][rails] web framework. As I happen to use it almost daily, and had
nothing better planned, I enrolled (again!), and was soon joined by [shakaman]:
I convinced him that rebuilding our clunky DeliciousLetter as a service would
be nice, and we would probably get Internet billionaires[^2] in a few weeks
after that.

Hence we exchanged a few ideas, napkin-ed a wireframe or two, and met online on
Friday evening to bootstrap our little idea. Truth be told, we probably are
terrible hackathon runners: we took breaks, beers, slept 6-7 hours nights, we
even showered, what a shame! Well, we were not aiming for gold, but rather an
excuse to collaborate on a little project, out of our current paid-for work. It
turned out great.

![HTML mails looked like this at some point... Lots of TODOs :p](http://static.cyprio.net/wtf/letter-screenshot.jpg)

As my partner is living in New-York, and I in Oaxaca, we setup a quick [Trello]
board to share a backlog, and chatted our way through the rest: no need for
more. New-York and Mexico's timezones are one hour apart, so this worked really
well.

At the end of the first day, we had a modest "MVP" which would connect with
Delicious or [Pocket], and generate responsive HTML newsletters from these.
Shakaman came up with a *really* nice design in no time, and did not complain
about the overall user experience, which is a little miracle considering we are
not exactly close to what we want (yet).

Then, I discovered that the [Heroku] host only allowed us only *one* measly
process to run all our application (seriously?). This "feature" had me rewrite
a few things to avoid background workers, so we could run in "heroku-mode" with
dumb cronjobs. I think I enjoy `git push heroku master` like the next geek, but
this was quite annoying at the time: I'm used to being root, and did not see
that one coming. My bad!


# So what's next?

Next? Well, we need to write tests to kill those many many bugs. We'd like to
add more services, real subscriptions, more mail templates, an on-boarding
process for new users, and a few other things before we consider showing more
that our little [Rails Rumble demo][demo].

However this is probably wishful thinking for now, as time is not really on our
side. Depending on how things are going, we *may* release an open-source
version (not before cleaning things up to avoid scaring our fellow Rubyists),
*or* just offer the service to a few friends.

Anyway, watch [this space][lespepitos] if you're interested in collaborative
free software.

[^1]: Delicious' only merit is probably its cost, because we are a very very
poor company and we can not afford [Pinboard].
[^2]: I'm still working on funding, I heard that I need to speak to some Paul
Graham, or something. This sounds a little boring TBH. :)
