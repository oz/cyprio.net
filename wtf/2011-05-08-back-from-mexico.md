title: "Back from mexico"
---

So I'm back to France. It's hot, and warm, and the weather's all nice, and the
people too. I'm glad to see some friends. The first thing I noticed, is how
calm this city seems, really. Barely a noise, less people in the streets or
around public places ranting about politics, no one's trying to play you music
in bars. No jukeboxes, since we don't have cantinas to start with. The cars
here are more efficient I guess, and less noisy, and adapted to their tiny
environment. Oh yeah, streets are really fucking small here. More ads, more
neons, stupidly high prices, and less mezcal.

So yeah, I miss Mexico. I'm gonna scheme an escape plan soon, first I need to
get rid of some things at my place, and hang that hamac somewhere.
