title: Wikileaks down (again) for releasing stuff (again)

> So we have a widespread network of surveillance cameras across America
monitoring us and reporting suspicious activity back to a centralized analysis
center, mixed in with the ability to imprison people via military force on the
basis of suspicious activity alone. I don't see how that could possibly go
wrong. Nope, not at all. We all know the government, and algorithmic computer
programs, never make mistakes.

Of course, nobody in the sec business is surprised. However it's funny that
Wikileaks' website has been down under a DDOS attack... I'd say the DDOS only
draws more attention to the release, but I'm not an expert. ;)
