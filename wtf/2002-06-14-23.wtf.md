title: "It's my aeroplane :)"
---

Looking in my own eyes  
I can't find the love I want  
Someone better slap me  
Before I start to rust  
Before I start to decompose  
Looking in my rear mirror  
Looking in my rear mirror  
I can make it disappear

I like pleasure spiked with pain  
Music is my aeroplane  
It's my aeroplane  
Songbird sweet and sour Jane  
It's my aeroplane

Sitting in my kitchen  
I'm turning into dust again  
My melancholy baby  
The star of mazzy must

Push her voice inside of me  
I'm overcoming gravity  
I'm overcoming gravity  
It's easy when you're sad to be

Just one note  
Could make me float  
Could make me float away  
One note from  
The song she wrote  
Could fuck me where I lay  
Just one note  
Could make me choke  
One note that's  
Not a lie  
Just one note  
Could cut my throat  
One could make me die
