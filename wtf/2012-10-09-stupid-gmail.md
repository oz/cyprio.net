title: Stupid Gmail
---

Just had one of those weird flashback moments, while GMail tried to helpfully
open a PDF obviously too heavy for its Google Docs's preview webapp.

The javascript is slow, the fonts are botched, overall it's almost like the
original, but a lot uglier: the Google User Experience? And, unexpected, a
memory from years ago when Steve Jobs presented the new super fast PDF reader
in the latest release of Apple's OS X.

Everything's not a webapp, yet. Let's be thankful for that, and also f*ck you
GMail.
