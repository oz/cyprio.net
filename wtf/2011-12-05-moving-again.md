title: Moving again.
---

Ok, new house rented... Hamac setup. Waiting for the internet, again: since
the cable operator does not cover the new home, we had to break our contract
with them, and have it the Telmex way. Telmex being the leading provider in
pretty much every forms of communication (landlines, cellphones, satellites,
...) in Mexico with an abusive monopoly, and prices. meh.

At the moment, I'm sitting in a public library where the net is free, and I
can plug my laptop all day long. However, I'm so fond of a few coffees around
there, that I can't really stay all day long. Caffeine levels must stay high.
:)
