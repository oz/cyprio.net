title: "The TV is watching you"
---

I don't watch _french_ TV at home, for a few reasons ranging from lack of
interest to lack of time ; and I'd rather listen to some music from
[somafm](http://somafm.com/), or a carefully crafted playlist than put on the
radio.

The only TV that I care about gets on my screen through the Internet... and -
how shameful - that's mostly US TV shows that aired one or two days ago on the
other side of the ocean. 99.99% of the time, I won't even look for subtitles
if that can yield a shorter delivery time (not because it's faster, because it
bothers me to look for them). Wether or not this is _entirely_ legal is not
really the point: I'm not willing to wait one or two years until a show that
sound great is imported, translated, or adapted in the some cases. You could
relate all of that to movies too.

If you haven't figured it out already, my point is that I'd rather pay those
TV studios, and radio stations, than the ones I do not care about. I'd be
willing to pay an "internet tax" rather than the global french-tv-tax, which
is unfair for the use I have of our national media networks.

So... when is that happening? Oh wait, no we have a shitload of laws to
protect our "undisputed" cultural superiority. I guess I'm screwed.
