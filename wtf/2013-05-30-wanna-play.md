The latest [Humble Bundle](http://humblebundle.com) includes [Hotline
Miami](http://hotlinemiami.com/). Giving to charity is a nice bonus for your
karma, but HM is a great way to spend some of the frustration when, for
example, [you've been skull-fucked](http://cyprio.net/wtf/2013-05-29-less-wisdom.html).

If this one's not your cup of tea, there are 7 other games. Name your price.
