title: "Back to a civilized time zone"
---

I'm finally back to a more civilized timezone! ... and enjoying the fine
weather here in Oaxaca. Not sure how long I'll stay, a few months, or years.
The place is fine, I can work in a calm environment, and "get things done"
faster, or so it seems. This morning I had to route the whole internet through
a VPN though since my usual morning coffee shop's wifi seems borked. I blame
their cable operator which only let me through google or slashdot... meh. I
guess these are the road-warrior's little troubles.

Friends are already booking their holidays to Mexico, which is a surprise to
me. I didn't think I'd see them again before I got back to France: how
pessimist can I be, huh? :)

Anyway, expect more updates once I get my own internet access at home.
