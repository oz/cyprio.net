title: "Laziness, impatience, and hubris"
---

Those are the free “virtues” of the programmer according to a well known book
on the Perl programming language... Let's see what happens when I consider
those virtues out of the computer context.

I know for a fact that I am lazy, pushing things to the last minute, and that
is quite embarrassing sometimes. Procrastination is the word, it's become very
popular among so-called geeks, and personal coaches.

I'm not sure if I am very much impatient, although I get easily bored at
things, ideas, or people after a while. Most of the time in a very polite and
quiet way ; meaning that if I can walk away I will, but I'm not in a hurry if
I can daydream. Daydreaming is good, please do so, it's when you get your
best/worse ideas. Like: hey, it's been a long time, let's blog!

Finally hubris... Now that's hard to admit. I'm sure I can be proud of stuff I
made, but if you ask me to pick an example, then I can't... yet? The fact is
(I hope) I'm just as much a human being as you are, then given a functional
brain and some time anyone could come up with the same sh*t I did ; so why
should I be proud of that? The only pride I take is in managing not to bother
anyone (_not_ easy).

That being said, hubris is also about self-confidence: a quality that I was
born without. Damn.

Next time, we'll see three other qualities: “attention to details”, “thirst
for blood”, and a “twisted mind”, the three virtues of the psychopath. Thank
you for your time.
