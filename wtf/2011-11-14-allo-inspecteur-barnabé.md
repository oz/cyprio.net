title: Allo, inspecteur Barnab√©?

Earlier this morning a woman called on my cellphone in Oaxaca. She was
actually trying to call an office at the Police headquarters of... Paris. I
felt sorry she was off by ten-thousand kilometers. :)

My cellphone is connected to a voip number in France, which make the confusion
quite possible.
