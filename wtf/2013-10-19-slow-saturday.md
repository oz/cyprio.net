title: "Slow saturday"

So it's Saturday night, and the girlfriend is busy painting because she needs
to deliver a copy tomorrow. No other friend in sight, so I though I'd climb on
the roof with a tripod and my camera to see how the sight is up there by
night...

Then of course, it started raining. T_T
