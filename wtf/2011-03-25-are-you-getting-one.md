Hm “regular computer users” by [these
standards](http://jpteti.com/post/4072771125/the-ipad-is-99-more-open-than-
any-other-computer) sure look like retards. Sometimes with tremendous success
of such vendor lock-downs and net-neutrality failing, I'm a little bit worried
about the future of computing. But hey it's all good for the “regular user”,
so don't worry and smile.
