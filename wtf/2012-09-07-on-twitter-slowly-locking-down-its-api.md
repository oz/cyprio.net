title: On twitter slowly locking down its API
---

Twitter must have a lot of bored managers/directors sitting at their [bad
decisions board](http://mashable.com/2012/09/05/twitter-api-rss/). The good
thing is, maybe a few people will realize they're being used, and start
looking at the alternatives.

IMHO _good_ alternatives could look a lot like [ADN](https://app.net), which
is to say user-centric rather than ad-based (forget FB, G+, etc). It's so
simple: caring about your users rather than squeeze revenue out of them
through ads.

I used ADN as "good example" because it has gained quite a lot of attention
lately. Attention means users, traction, kind words from TechCrunch, that kind
of boring non-technical details... It is far from perfect though. The worse
thing about it is that being based on user subscriptions makes it completely
_centralized_. My inner geek is hurt. I want my Internets decentralized, with
standardized, open protocols. As a matter of fact, technically,
[identi.ca](https://identi.ca) would fit perfectly here. If only people
(including its original owners) would stop thinking of it as "a Twitter
clone"... People don't want copies of Twitter, they want Twitter. Make
something new and different, or at least _pretend it's different enough_. Sure
it's stupid, but aren't we too? Because it seems to work quite well for ADN.

BTW, I'm [@ephoz](https://twitter.com/ephoz) on Twitter. ;)
