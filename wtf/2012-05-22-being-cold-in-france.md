title: Being cold, in France.
---

I did it! A month without a post, weee! Well. Let's complain.

I've been in France since the beginning of this month, and well the weather's
kinda _against_ us here: it's fucking cold and rainy. I've been in Paris for
the first two weeks of the month, and am now on holiday to visit my parents in
Auvergne. Of course, things here are even worse: The internet connection is
even slower than the (cheapest) one I'm subscribed to in Mexico. So I have one
thing to say here: what the fuck?

I am really looking forward to going back to Mexico in June. Almost there...
On the good-news front, we changed president, and the worse one lost. :)
