title: A year in France
---

It's not easy to summarize in a few words, how I feel about our latest months in
France.

To start with, terrorists (we?) have turned the country into a less-free place.
There are more controls, and proportionally less privacy, less freedom. Nothing
to be proud of, unless you are one of those short-sighted politicians that
govern the damn place. I am not sure I know how to write politely about all
this, so let me keep my thoughts for myself a little more.

On the other hand, I found a lot of fun in our humble [Epistoli][] project. I am
currently assuming the (very startupy) CTO role, meaning I get to setup
invisible services and write back-end code in Ruby or Go, while my co-founder is
playing with more buzzword friendly technologies: Javascript, [React][], who
could resist?

If you forget the Javascript for a second, it is actually quite an interesting
project. We get to write chatter bots, ~~play~~ cope with APIs, write our own, *etc.* In
time, we will put some energy into engaging clients, because building a product
is of course of no use unless you advertise it, and we are still blocking
crawlers from indexing our stuff. To be honest, we are stretching a little the
building part: this could be because we both spent some years making stuff for
other people, and have found here a great playground, yet unspoiled of
responsibilities. This is a dangerous place to be when you want to actually make
things, so we will move off soon enough.

Meanwhile, this whole enterprise is an opportunity to release some open-source
code. First, as the informal collective [Les Pepitos][], and secondly as the
[Epistoli][epgh] entity of course. In case you wondered, *epistoli* is greek for
*letter* ; the word may not stick forever but (news)letters are the most
tangible thing or application is producing at the moment -- hence the simple
name.

This is is how I start 2016. Hopefully, I will write more this year than the
past. No promises though. Thanks for reading.
