title: The wonderfull wizard of Oz

"I thought Oz was a great head," said Dorothy.  
"And I thought Oz was a lovely lady," said the Scarecrow.  
"And I thought Oz was a terrible beast," said the Tin Woodman.  
"And I thought Oz was a ball of fire," exclaimed the Lion.  
"No, you are all wrong," said the little man meekly. "I have been making
believe."  
"Making believe!" cried Dorothy. "Are you not a Great Wizard?"  
"Hush, my dear," he said. "Don't speak so loud, or you will be overheard - and
I should be ruined. I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard."  
"And aren't you?" she asked.  
"Not a bit of it, my dear ; I'm just a common man."
