title: "Holiday report #82a3"

It's confusing how I manage to sleep so little when on holiday. maybe work's
less amusing than running around in California. The longest trip we made so
far was from SF to LA, artificially long to enjoy a little more of the West
coast's natural parks, which _are_ ridiculously huge, and amazing... Anyway,
we'll be staying in LA for a few days, then head East to the Mojave desert and
canyons, and whatever comes when one's trying to follow the dead route 66. We
should eventually take a break at the so called “Bagdad café”, stop here and
there to take lousy pictures of the US, and if we're lucky enough, be back to
Vegas, a day before our plane leaves. :)

I'm also anticipating the horror of sorting, and uploading the flood of
pictures to Flickr, so I got an iPad (yes... it is related, sort of). However,
for now, it's time for coffee, and banana-walnut bread. *runs away*
