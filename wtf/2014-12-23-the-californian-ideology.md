title: "The Californian Ideology"

This one, my dear reader, may apply to you:

So much for the hacker mask that so many kids from the Silicon Valley like to
wear. I have identified with the hacker image for a long time, but I like to
think it is more a trait, than a belief or a religion: people would certainly
write books on what it means to be a hacker, what do hackers do, or think. But I
can not identify with *all* of it: did I outgrew these ideas long ago, or did
they evolve without me noticing?

Surely, there is something very self absorbed in this little Californian
hacker-land. But are there alternatives? What other model does Europe offer? As
far as I can tell, it is all startups, funding rounds, and accelerators on both
sides of the Atlantic. Take the money and run: there is no place in the world
where the game is different, except maybe under fascist regimes. Great, let's
have more kings...

How would you grow a business that actively contributes to the betterment of
society? Is that exclusively the state's job, and is it even possible given the
capitalistic nature of the enterprise in our world? Are those things
hackers would even care about?

Anyway, there is this [whole text][src] (from 2007!), trying to draw a picture
of what has been happening in California. It is still remarkably right in my
humble opinion. Go read that, it is probably more interesting than my ramblings.
