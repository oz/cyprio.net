title: Things to do before...
---

I should find a guide for people relocating to another country, and more
precisely "leaving France". There's so much to be done before the end of
september, it seems I only add things to my todo list right now. On the "done"
front, I'll be without a home at the end of september (which is good news!),
and I think I sold almost everything I wanted gone ; now I only need to stash
a few things (books, clothes, porn collection, _etc._) at my parents' place,
or wherever they'd be marginally safe.

Now's the time when I wonder... where I can have my backup-box stored too? It
slept at home, gently streaming audio to pulse, or quietly activating at times
to rsync with a handful of boxes, but that would be a pain between France and
Mexico. That's _if_ I did found a safe place with broadband network to store
it too! And I won't travel with 4Tb of data in my pockets. Ideas?

Oh yeah, I should get dressed and go to work. Gotta throw more javascript at
that crazy UI thing we're doing for a major french TV group. :)
