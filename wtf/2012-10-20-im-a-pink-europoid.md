title: "I'm a pink europoid"
---

I was filling immigration papers in Mexico, when I was asked for my "race". I
decided to check the official help for this particular form, feeling I was
probably some kind of “caucasian” or "europoid". Turns out my race is simply
_white_. The choices are (translated word for word): “White, Yellow (asian);
Black, Native/indigenous/Aboriginal, Mixed Race” .

First, I'm not white you big racist non-politically correct government. I'm
rather pink-ish, especially true after unexpected exposure to direct sunlight.
I'm kinda shocked that in Mexico, some people are _yellow_ and hey in case you
did not get it, it really means _asian_, between parenthesizes. Race questions
always seems simpler in governmental forms than on Wikipedia.

So in case you were wondering, I still get cultural shocks, and think these
people are a little crazy. :)
