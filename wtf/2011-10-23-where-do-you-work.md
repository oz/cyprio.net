title: Where do you work?
---

I really like this [philisophy page](http://gun.io/philosophy/) at gun.io.
It's about how our sedentary life (as coders) is a little bit off, considering
the technology and opportunities that we now have to _move_.

I'm settling for a while in Mexico which means I'm trying to apply these
guidelines to the letter. I'm not sure how it will work in the end, good I
hope. What is certain is that the world is not _that_ big. For example Mexico
is just twelve hours from french-land: add airport friction to the equation,
it's just a one day trip. Instead of taking your car/train to commute to the
same place for the rest of your life, grab a plane and start exploring ; while
you have time. I guess it is that simple.
