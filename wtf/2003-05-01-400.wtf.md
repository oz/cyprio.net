You are Vlad the Impaler. The man behind the legend  
of Dracula. You hanged your victims, stretched  
them on the rack, burned them at the stake,  
boiled them alive, but mostly impaled them.  
Most of your killings were politically targeted  
but sometimes you killed just because you were  
bored. Your "reign of terror" lasted  
from 1456 to 1462. Estimated numbers of victims  
vary between 30,000 and more than 100,000.  
Evil Evil man. Fie on you!
