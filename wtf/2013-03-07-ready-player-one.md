title: Ready Player One
---

I really try not to bore the world with the few books I read. However,
yesterday I finished [Ready Player
One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One). It's super light SF,
easy to read to get some light stuff in your mind. Plus, I just noticed the
audio-book version was narrated by Wil Wheaton, which I guess adds some geek
creds to the book. If you grew up in the eighties, then read it, if only for
the various cultural references (music, comics, films, video-games, ...) that
less and less people will get, but also because it's fun.
