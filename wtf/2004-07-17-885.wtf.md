title: evil geniuses for dummies
---

« You are an SEDF — Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an
_evil genius_. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your
tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving
your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting. Your friends
may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very
well — even those you have known a long time — because you have expert control
of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate,
discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is
impenetrable. You are not to be messed with. You may explode. »
