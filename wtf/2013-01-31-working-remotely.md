title: Working remotely
---

A few links, and rants for remote workers, and telecommuters. In spite of
moving to Mexico, I have kept working with [af83](http://af83.com) for two
years. Seven hours and roughly 10,000km separate us. A few things that make it
possible are awesome people, positive energy, and our taste for
experimentation in technology _and_ environment. Here's to the nomadic
mindset.
