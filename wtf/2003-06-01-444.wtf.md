_Everything is possible_ comme ils disent. D'ailleurs ils le prouvent :)

An employee of Hewlett-Packard who broke quarantine to go to work despite
showing symptoms of SARS has become one of the latest casualties of the
disease.  
The 62-year-old man, who died Saturday night, was a long-time employee at the
company's information processing plant in Markham. He succumbed to the disease
after a lengthy stay in hospital, becoming the city's 27th victim of SARS.  
The man's illness has been linked to the original outbreak by health
authorities who called for a total quarantine of the HP plant last month when
they learned the man could have knowingly placed nearly 200 co-workers in
danger.

Si vous avez un HP vous aller donc mourrir du virus de l'espace. C'est bien
