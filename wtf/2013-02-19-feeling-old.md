Opening the ham inbox this morning, I'm met with a Flickr-mail...

    
    
      
    Subject: [Flickr] You've been invited to join Age is Just a Number

What is this, I thought, am I already entering that age when you're invited me
to support groups for thirty-somethings that can't bear their years?

Proceeding to the group's page, I'm met with the following description:

> **About Age is Just a Number.**

>

> A cool relaxed place for photographers under 25 of all levels to learn &
share and meet new friends.

Surprise! So actually, I'm too old? Crap, you're never the right age for
something, and age is not just a number. Stupid kids.
