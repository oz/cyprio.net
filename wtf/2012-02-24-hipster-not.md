title: "Hipster not"
---

Chromium has become half of my day-job environment. It has the nicest debugger
out there, it's snappy, and that's all I need for testing web apps lately. On
the other end, Firefox's (currently beta 11) is my goto-browser for everything
else. The Pentadactyl extension is a blessing for my fingers (except when
dealing with web-apps that try to dispute the keyboard with pentadactyl: It
won't let them), and the mouse... well who uses mouse anymore? All you need is
a keyboard and/or a touch-screen.

Recently, one thing struck me in this setup. Chromium has opened tabs that
deal with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and the likes of it, while Firefox is all about
nodejs, and coffee-script. Lately, it seems that there's a growing trench
between what I do to _eat_, and what I _enjoy_ in computers.
