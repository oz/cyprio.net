My generation was born with the Internet, we've been online before they even
noticed their stupid minitel was gone. And now those old fucks are trying to
harm the damn thing because they're scared of it!? “OMG people are talking and
exchanging information we can't control right under our nose.” I wonder if
they'll find slaves stupid enough to twist our network into a shopping mall,
because that's what “regulation” means. Let's hope they do not.
