title: "Old things"
---

I just received an e-mail from my grand-father reacting to my “new” car:

He wrote something something like “aah I owned one of those too in 1972! Be
careful.” This particular VW was made in 1973. My grand-father wins! Then I
realized I also own other _old things_ like this [Yashica camera](http
://yashica-guy.com/) which was manufactured in the sixties, and that I really
_love_ although it's too heavy and has totally-not-leica-grade glass:

I don't care, I like [taking pictures with it](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ep
hoz/sets/72157631223094908/with/7851087676/). My point here is not to say “hey
look at my cool old stuff”, since most of you probably don't give a fuck about
those antique and unpractical objects. I own a more recent (and practical!
look at me I'm normal!) digital DSLR camera, it's not unlike a friend's one.
However his camera is now dying a slow death after _5 years of service_. Of
course the warranty's expired, and in a few months it'll be useless, and worth
very little.

So this is really a post to say **fuck you to [planned
obsolescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence)**! Because of
this, I'm amazed when I find old things that _still_ work, while this should
be the norm.

Hey look I almost managed to not mention Apple up to this point and ... shit.
Thanks for reading.
