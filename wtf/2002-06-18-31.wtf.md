title: "Greet Scite"

[Contrary to popular misconception -- perpetuated through mass-market
consensus and countless media sources -- hackers do not, by definition, break
into systems.  
Setting aside the argument that categorical conflation works just fine for
casual conversations -- in which you might need to employ verbal shorthand to
communicate more quickly -- it irks me every time I hear the term "hacker"
used solely to indicate a person who breaks into systems with malicious
intent.

All the portscans, inbound UDP frags and SubSeven Trojan attacks that my
firewall blocks aren't perpetuated by hackers, who have far better things to
do with their time. No, these small-scale attacks are well within the province
of crackers and script kiddies, who almost always use easily acquired software
to play their game.](http://www.blackcode.com)
