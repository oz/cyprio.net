title: Oaxaca again?
---

[Oaxaca, Oaxaca](http://oaxaca.cyprio.net/) has landed. It's a small
(incomplete) jekyll powered blog, where I'll post updates and pictures mostly
for friends and family. If you're into that, check it out. It's in french
since my parents, and most of my relatives, do not read Shakespeare's mother
tongue quite as well as you (probably) do.

Also, I should mention that I am officially in love with jekyll's simplicity.
:)
