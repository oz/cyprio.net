title: There and back again
---

It's interesting that there's still a post about joining [MailPoet] on
the homepage. It makes this place feel very dusty, full of cobwebs, and
memories, and this post kind of ironical.

I stayed at MailPoet for more or less 2 years. I remember feeling
exhausted and depressed at the end of it. A nice *burnout* to use the
proper term: yes, you could get burnout before the COVID pandemic. These
were the days! That was mostly my fault for not seeing it coming, but
not entirely.

Now what's new? After some freelancing gigs here and there, I've joined
back MailPoet ; now part of that "little" company that makes a well-known
CMS. I still don't use it to publish these few rants, or become rich
with my newsletter, but it's running *somewhere* where I share some
pictures of the kid, from time to time.

I'm still not a big fan of PHP (and not writing any, which should be
reassuring for the knowledgable PHP folks), but I really like working
with open-source, and making tools that solve the problems of actual
people.

Let's try to avoid burnout this time because I feel too old to job-hop
like a jumpy millenial ; and there's still work to do.
