## Bloom review

I just added a [reviewing section][reviews] to the site. It is quite empty for
now, with only a few notes on [Bloom][bloom] that I read this week-end.  You
could say I have quite a backlog since the book was published in 1998, but the
truth is, sometimes, I pick randomly from various book-worms recommendations.

If SF does not bore you too much, I recommend it anyway. :)

## Another feed to read?

Since my little reviews are probably not interesting every one, this section
has its own [feed][feed] that you can subscribe to.

## Future plans...

I'm not sure about the whole multiple feeds for one domain thing. On one hand
it doesn't hurt, on the other I should probably generate a "general" feed and
properly `<link>` to it from the home page's header.

As I'm using Git to handle the source and texts on this web site, it would be a
little weird not to use Git's log to generate a *very* general RSS/Atom feed.
It should track every little change made here and there, which seem appropriate
given the other "less noisy" feeds will still be in place.

So that's the plan for the next features, and a very good excuse to get to know
[Hakyll][]'s built-in types better.
