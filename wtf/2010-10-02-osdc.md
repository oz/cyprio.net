title: "OSDC"

The french [OSDC](http://osdc.fr) is happening next week-end in Paris. If
you're around and interested in a little chat about your favorite
technology/programming language, come and meet us. As for myself, I'll be
giving a little introduction and overview of [node.js](http://nodejs.org),
which has considerably contributed to making “server-side javascript”
mainstream again.

Maybe you don't care about all that javascript stuff as much as I do. On the
other hand, the schedule includes talks about Perl and Perl 6,
[Dancer](http://perldancer.org), Smalltalk, PHP (which should contrast against
last year “light” contribution of the PHP community) ; and some lightning
talks on a few ruby gems... Did I mention there will be talks on postgresql,
and even some nosql-related on riak, redis?

Well, I did my part of buzzing... Oh, and there'll most probably be an after-
event with beer, geeks, and no trolls about The One True Language. See you
around. :)
