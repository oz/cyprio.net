We've been here and there, ate at the Bagdad caf√©, found a bar in the desert
where the beer costs $1 during football games, got back from the Valley of
Death, which must mean we're (deep fried) zombies now, been arrested (just
once, I promise) for speeding on California's roads. Tomorrow's our last day
in the country, and so we'll be in Vegas, trying various ways of being drunk,
and/or losing money. Mind you, we've almost killed the rental car, with around
2000 miles in two weeks. That's a start. However, for now the evening program
consists in trying the various sorts of tequilas at that awesome place just
around the corner.

Hopefully, we'll be back to Paris by sunday morning...
