ce qu'[elle](http://www.nacara.net) peut trouver :)...  
Enfin c'est pas vraiment elle, mais plutôt [lui](http://frites.free.fr/) mais
on s'en tape après tout... :p

_The name of Oz creates a quick, analytical, and clever mind; you are
creative, versatile, original, and independent. You have large ambitions, and
it is difficult for you to be tolerant and understanding of those who desire
less in life or who are more slow and methodical by nature. Patience is not
your forte. You do, however, have leadership ability and would never be happy
in a subservient position. You are ambitious and aggressive by nature. You
would be happiest in positions where you are free to express individually and
creatively and where opportunities are not restricted; you desire freedom, and
do not tolerate being possessed by others. You appreciate change and travel,
and the opportunity to meet and mix with others, and to influence them with
your creative ideas. You are very self-confident and feel you can accomplish
anything you set out to do, and you can, although, this name does not allow
proper completion of undertakings, and forced changes cause financial losses
and bitter experiences. This name also creates caustic expression and moods
which prevent harmony and happiness in close association. When under strain,
tension could affect the stomach and solar plexus. There is a tendency for you
to worry. _
