I can guarantee that these jokes have zero chance of making people laugh in
real life.

> A TCP packet walks into a bar and says to the bartender, "I'd like a beer."
The  
bartender says, "You'd like a beer?" The TCP packet says, "Yes, a beer."

> I know this great UDP joke but you might not get it.

Now, if you did smile. Thanks.
