title: "How can I avoid turning into a pointy-haired boss?"
---

> The pointy-haired boss is a manager who doesn't program. So the surest way
to avoid becoming him is to stay a programmer. What tempts programmers to
become managers are companies with old-fashioned corporate structure, where
the only way to advance in salary and prestige is to go into management. So if
you want to avoid becoming a PHB, avoid such companies, and work for (or
start) startups.

> I never had to manage anyone in our startup, even though I was the
president. The other hackers were my peers, and would have given me the
raspberry if I'd tried to "manage" them. We operated by consensus. And the
rest of the company reported to our experienced COO, who was also more of a
peer.

From Paul Graham's [Rarely-asked
questions](http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html). I really like his answer here
since it does underline a few facts about not _making_ things yourself. Use
your own hands to build things, even small ones, or just for yourself. Don't
try to stand on other people but _rely_ on them. :)
