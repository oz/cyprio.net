title: "How to disappear"

_why and later Pilgrim committed the first infosuicides of our information
age. However their methods seem to be lacking, since all their online presence
has been thoroughly backed-up by magical Internet gerbils around the globe.
I've come to think that another way, maybe better, is to let content rot and
fall into obsolescence.

With time, and less linking to old content, your online presence gradually
fades. You've become a fossil, and really few people wonder about those
things. Don't cancel all your domain names, don't erase all your public
code/prose from the net, just let it rot here for the world to forget.
