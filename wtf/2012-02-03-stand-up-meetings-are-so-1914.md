title: Stand-up meetings are so 1914

> Holding meetings standing up isn't new. Some military leaders did it during
World War I, according to Allen Bluedorn, a business professor at the
University of Missouri. A number of companies have adopted stand-up meetings
over the years. Mr. Bluedorn did a study back in 1998 that found that standing
meetings were about a third shorter than sitting meetings and the quality of
decision-making was about the same.

We've been doing our fair share of stand-up meetings at
[af83](http://af83.com) for a while, following one cool “agile” method or
another. The “agile” world changes quite a lot, and it's a good thing: it
means we are trying to improve. The fact is our sometimes improvised stand-up
meetings have annoyed the people nearby: those not attending (willing-fully).
That's because the office is setup in an open-space fashion, and many still
have trouble with the whole “let's book a room” thing.

Stand-up meetings are definitely shorter and more to the point, however I've
come to appreciate sitting through meetings in a chair thousands of kilometers
away from my team mates. Or better, lazily resting in a hammock: stress-less
meetings at their best. But then I wonder how does that stand-up meeting
revolution work with remote work? Does it mean each person is standing alone
in front of her microphone and/or webcam? Silly.

The next best thing is no meetings.
