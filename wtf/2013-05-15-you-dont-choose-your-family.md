title: "You don't choose your family"
---

I've been visited by more friends than family in Mexico. It's not a surprise –
many of my expat friends have experienced the same thing – given how much _I_
want to visit my family. Not that we hate each others either. :)

Still, it's a weird feeling that when you move away from your parents' nest,
it becomes your responsability to get back there from time to time, to connect
with your roots, and other emotional _clichés_.

Anyway, I'm working with a french colleague this week, and it feels weird to
have company after months working alone at home, or in my favorite coffee
shops. Good thing about visits, I get to move my shiny non-metallic ass to the
_playa_. Again. Life has been way too good with me lately. :)
