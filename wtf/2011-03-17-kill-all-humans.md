title: kill all humans
---

What's so great about the nuclear threats in Japan, is that apparently, one
must choose between two antagonist positions and explain to the internet in
great length why it is the best...

The **ecologist** believes the accidents are another proof that nuclear energy
is a mistake, plus they produce so much waste, blah blah blah.

The **rationalist with a hidden agenda** believes nuclear plants are the only
sustainable option, and perfectly safe once you've dismantled the antiques
built according to designs from the 70s.

At any rate, our greed for energy would seem to be the root of this problem ;
which leaves us two choices: being less greedy of our resources (laugh here),
or annihilate a good part of the human population ([with some help from the
pidjins](http://pidjin.net)). But please, whether you're an ecologist (yay for
green energy!), or a rationalist (yay for critical thinking), shut the fuck up
about it for once. Thank you.
