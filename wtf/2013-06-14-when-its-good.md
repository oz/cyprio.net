title: When it's good
---

Received today an order for a bunch of Kodak Ektar, and TX films (I can't find
these around here), and [a bunch of
books](https://duckduckgo.com?q=daido+moriyama) to make the shipping cost more
reasonable. This is roughly two weeks before the estimated delivery time from
Amazon. I always complain of shipping companies, but never praise when they're
doing a good job. There: I love you DHL.
