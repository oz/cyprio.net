title: Unemployed

2015 started with a big move from Oaxaca's small village, back to the
big city I had happily left a few years ago. We have been quite busy
looking for our new home, navigating the French administration to get
health coverage, visas, etc.

Reconnecting with friends gave me some opportunities to finally leave a
company where I had no intention to stay much longer. As much as I
enjoyed my time at af83, after a few years I got the impression that I
would receive little from the company no matter my efforts. This may not
be the case, but this is how it felt at the time.

And so I abandoned.

After losing interest in the company, I got quite bored of my daily life
and decided to leave for Mexico. After all, Oaxaca is a pretty awesome
place, and I knew I could do my job just as well, away from a company
that did not offer me much in Paris. I then discovered that Mexico can
be a lot more than a cute tourist spot, but that is another story.

Back to 2015, as we decided to move back to France, it was never with
the intention of slipping back into my old skin. Rather, I planned to
look for what would be next.

## Trying new things

Then, two friends offered me different paths: either take an engineering
job at well-funded startup, or jump down the rabbit hole to start a
business.

As things go, I wanted to try to fit in at a new company. So, I quit my
old lifeless engineer position, for a new more exciting engineer
position. And all was well, for a little while.

Daily commutes to the office, daily stand-up meetings, a weekly code
freeze before the push to production: the well oiled mechanics of our
technical jobs were at work again with little to no pressure. Success
was (is?) attainable, it would come after a few months of work: just
make sure that the platform can handle new features, more traffic, and
generate more profits.

I was part of a cool machine, and yet still thought of my own little project. I
kept working on it on my free time, and soon it was clear that I had made the
wrong choice. And again I quit. I was a lot less comfortable leaving a great
work environment, but I needed to.

So here I am, officially unemployed, building a business because it seems fun
and different from what I have always done. I hope I can get by with the
government's pension for a while, then we'll see...
