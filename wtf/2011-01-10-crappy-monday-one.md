Today we're supposed to see a few guys, at work, from one of our biggest,
wealthiest, and dumbest client. We are expected to train them on the tech we
developed those past few months for SomeBigWebsite ; so that our contract will
leave us with the development of new features, while they'll work on support,
maintenance, bug fixing, etc. While this is not necessarily a bad thing (I
mean I could care less), there is a huge problem here: me doing PHP
training... WTF?
