The box hosting this website is showing signs of weakness. While I've had a
"spare", shared with [davux](http://weeno.net), for several months, I can't
let myself say goodbye to that good ol' freebsd OS. Anyway, the hard-drive's
dying, and if you were hosted on this box, you should receive an e-mail with a
new IP soon (meanwhile, rest assured that your data is archived daily).
