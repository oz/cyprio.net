title: "moving disks"

Since I'm leaving France for a "little trip" to Mexico, I thought I'd sell my
current laptop (a sturdy Lenovo X200) to get something more up to date. After
a week fighting with TNT's delivery <s>service</s> <s>support </s> morons, I
finally got my hands on a brand new [X220](http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/18
/lenovo-thinkpad-x220-review/). Size is the same, weight does not change that
much since I wanted a decent battery life, but overall, it's a _fucking_ win.

But.

The engineers at Lenovo thought it would be fun to have a _slightly_ smaller
space to cram a HDD in your laptop, and so my good old SSD (Crucial C300, so
far so good) did not fit (too big “that's what she said” blah blah). I had to
remove a “useless” part of it following [this guy's
advice](http://forum.notebookreview.com/lenovo-ibm/572145-x220-ssd-7mm-mod-
crucial-c300.html), and boot the laptop hoping it'd be happy this way.

... A firmware package download later (wifi driver), the Debian boots up like
nothing happened deciphering my home as usual. Er... I wanted to say that I
love when software just works, and oh thank the geeks that kindly make it so
(you won't never read these lines, but still, thank you guys).

Also, did I mention I got my plane tickets for september, 30th? Did I mention
I'm just as anxious as I'm happy about all this? I hope things work out well
at my dayjob, and once I get there too. It'll be the second time I'll be
living in Oaxaca, but still.
