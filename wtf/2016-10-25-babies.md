I have put my startup-y projects aside for a while now. There is only so much
time that I would invest in something that won't pay its server bills, no
matter how fun it is. Still, not easy.

Anyway, to move on I joined [MailPoet] a few months ago, taking over a project
that had been entirely developed by one person, using a technology that no one
else there knew very well (why?). That one person decided to leave. Rather than
let the project die, MailPoet decided to hire a new person: I have a few
years of experience doing ruby and devops, so the role fits me quite well.

Furthermore, I am used to 100% remote work, the team _is_ nice, the
to-be-announced project is as awesome as it is challenging. New team, new
project, new things to learn. _So far, so good_.

So you know, new job is nice and all, but I will focus on more important things
for now, like my new born daughter. :)
