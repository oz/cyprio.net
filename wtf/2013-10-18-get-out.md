title: Get out
---

I work from home most of the time (big screen with
[typematrix](http://www.typematrix.com/) <3). So with time, my home is really
like my *office*. At the same time it is also the workshop where my girlfriend
spends most of her time painting...

Our place is probably not the typical dream home, it's a little bit messy:
there's stuff everywhere because we don't need it to be another way. We need a
place to think and work on our creations (be they bits, or paintings), and
occasionally socialize with other human beings. :)

At any rate, I grow bored rapidly if I have to sit at the same place every
day. More so if my current tasks are not giving me the joy and passion I'm
craving. I wish work could be fun 100% of the time, but it's not. :)

So, getting out of *the office* every once in a while really helps a lot. Try
it. :)
