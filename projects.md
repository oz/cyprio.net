Most of what I've hacked is published on my [git server](https://git.cypr.io/oz).
Here's a sample.

# Aguaxaca

- Main instance online [here](https://agua.cypr.io), as of 2025.
- [Source](https://git.cypr.io/oz/aguaxaca).

This is an Go/SQLite/LLM project I've built to gather the water delivery
schedules in the city of Oaxaca de Juarez, in Mexico. These public
schedules are published as JPEGs on X/Twitter and Facebook, which is not
ideal, for lots of reasons.

For now, the goal is mainly to archive: gather the JPEGs, extract proper
text thanks to a LLM, and store that for posterity, analytics, and
to make the data accessible to everyone.

# mdstat

- [Source](https://git.cypr.io/oz/mdstat)

In simpler times, I used [(neo)mutt](https://neomutt.org/) much
more to read and send emails. mdstat is a helper that checks local
maildirs to populate the sidebar of neomutt. You can read about it
[here](https://cyprio.net/wtf/2022-09-25-mdstat.html). It's mainly a
"let's try [zig](https://ziglang.org)" project.

# TZ

- [Source](https://github.com/oz/tz)

TZ is a TimeZone helper program for the terminal, started around 2021.
It's one of these scratch-your-own-itch super simple utils that you
write, but get a surprise when other people find these useful.

# Gist

- [Source](https://git.cypr.io/oz/gist)

Gist is a GitHub Gist client for the terminal. It has one job, it does it well. Not much
else to say. One of the first things I ever wrote in Rust. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Objeto Buffet

This one uses open-source a lot, but is not. I maintain the WooCommerce
shop of Objeto Buffet: an art gallery, and shop in the center of Oaxaca
de Juarez, Mexico. Sometimes, WordPress *is* the answer.
