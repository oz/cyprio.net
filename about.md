# About this website

I have never been very good at maintaining websites.  However, as I sometimes
feel the need to write (sorry about that), I once decided that keeping an
online repository would help.  Of course it does not: it has been fun (and
time-consuming) when I had the leisure to roll my own software for the task,
and boring at best when I tried to use other people's soup.

So, I guess that this is the N-th attempt, using a great piece of software
named [hakyll][hakyll] which sits on the fine line between *DIY* and *not my
business*.

Finally, this site helps me a lot to keep in touch with family and friends. As
I have been living away from most of them for quite a while, and not all can
afford to travel to Mexico, France, or wherever.

# About the author

I'm a French guy, currently living in France with my [wife][karina].  I have
lived in Mexico for four years, before deciding to move back to France with
vague plans to go back in a few years... Maybe?  We are not that bad at making
plans, just a little bit undecided.

I have been employed as a programmer or software engineer for too many years
now.  I am still not tired of making things though.  I guess this grants me a
*geeky* tag, but I do not really care about it.

While in Mexico, I worked from home, and local *cafés* for a few years, but in
Paris I *have to* [enjoy an open-space office every single day][openspace].
Had you asked then, I would probably have said that I did not care, but remote
work provides so much liberty, flexibility, and productivity that I'm
embarrassed, and concerned when great people are *forced* into noisy open-space
offices.  So yes, I do care and think 100% office time is too much for our
field of work.  The guys at 37signals wrote [an excellent book][remote] on the
topic that you *must* read.

## Computers

Curiosity is the main reason I'm into computers, and also a sense of
practicality: I like to (re-)program things around me to do whatever I want.
This is sadly less and less permitted by hardware and software vendors, and so
requires more patience and skills than it should.

### I'm using this

I'm mainly using two laptops. First a [Lenovo X220][x220] that's been with me
since it was released, running [Debian][debian], [Freebsd][freebsd], or lately
[Archlinux][archlinux]. I spend most of my time in [Urxvt][urxvt] terminals
running [tmux][tmux], and let [Xmonad][xmonad] manage windows for me.  I use
[Firefox][firefox] for browsing, and [Chromium][chromium] for web development.
I store my passwords in [KeepassX][keepass], and synchronize files between
various disks using a combination of [Bittorrent Sync][btsync] and
[git-annex][gitannex].

Daily, I'm editing code in [VIM][vim] using a combination of [Ruby][ruby],
[Javascript][node], [Go][golang], and [Haskell][haskell]. I wish I could play
more with [Rust][rust], [Elixir][elixir], or [Nim][nimlang]... The thing is
that yes, I'm probably interested in your new programming language.

From time to time, I use macs. So for work, I carry an 11" [Macbook Air][mba]
which I love for its weight, size, and hardware, but hate for its software and
stupid keyboard layout. Adobe's [Lightroom][lightroom] doesn't run (yet?) on
Linux, so Apple is getting my money here. Steve also sold me an [iPhone
4S][iphone_4s] that refused to die after years of mistreatments, and is now in
the hands of my wife. I now run [SailfishOS][sailfish] on [Jolla's
phone][jolla], because *it just works* and is a little less vulnerable than the
average iOS/Android setup.

## Photography

I have been into photography on and off for years. A few years ago, I got a
small [Leica D-Lux][dlux], and experimented for a while until I decided I
needed more serious gear. So I upgraded to a fat [Canon 5D][5d] (mark 2 at the
time) which kept me busy for years, until I sold it. Canon makes great DSLRs
and their prime lenses are excellent, but I wanted lighter, less flashy gear.

I had been playing with borrowed [Holga][holga] and [Diana][diana] cameras,
when I decided that they were horribly bad for me. But film was a fun
distraction, I was bit and I got myself the little [Lomo LCA+][lomo] that I now
carry everywhere. Lastly, I found a [Leica M6][m6] in really good shape on
e-bay, and bought a 35mm lens for it.  I always carry those two in my camera
bag, and I hope to have quenched my Gear Acquisition Syndrome for some years.

I am by no mean a professional nor an artist, but photography has proven a very
good way to get me out of my comfort zone, and has allowed me to meet
incredible people around the world.  Finally, shooting film rather than only
digital is part of a collection of details and setups that make my brain
happier.  Which is a good reason to keep using film as long as they sell it.

I am not a photo geek either, but I enjoy these guys' works:
[Maier][vivian-maier], [Koudelka][koudelka], [Parr][parr], [Álvarez
Bravo][alvarez-bravo], [Moriyama][moriyama], [Lange][lange], and many more I
can not remember right now... Have a look!

# Still reading?

I have many projects related to my interests. One of these is to own all the
data I produce voluntarily online, in order to make it available under this
domain first-hand, before federating to various services. However, time is not
my friend, and you'll find me on various centralized online services:

 * I share code [on Github][github],
 * I [tweet][twitter],
 * and publish pictures, mostly [on Flickr][flickr].
