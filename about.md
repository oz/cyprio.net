# About the author

Hi there! I'm a French guy, sharing my life between France and Mexico
with my [wife][karina] and kid. Currently I am in: _Oaxaca, Mexico_.

I've been working as a software engineer for some years now, that means
[I understand how everything went so wrong](https://xkcd.com/1760/), not
necessarily how to fix it. ;) Still, I enjoy making things with
computers and believe open-source is the best way to share and learn
together.

I've worked remotely for years, but I can assure you that I like to meet
people. :)


# Computers

Curiosity is the main reason I'm into computers, and also a sense of
practicality: I like to (re-)program things around me to do whatever I
want. Not always what the vendor thought would be nice. This is sadly
less and less permitted by hardware and software vendors, and so
requires more patience and skills than it should, but we can still have
tons of fun.

If you've ever had to replace a battery in an appliance, a broken phone
screen, or modify retail electronics, you know how this sucks. We must
improve that in order to be free, and produce less waste.

# I'm using this

I'm writing this on an M2 Apple laptop, a gift from a previous employer.
I also have an older [Dell XPS 13][xps13], which I keep around to run
[Archlinux][archlinux] (BTW) on actual hardware. I've had the laptop for
years, it's less powerful than most smartphones, and I've changed a few
parts along the road. I also run some homelab things on 2 [rpis][rpis],
also running Linux.

I spend most of my time in terminals running [tmux][tmux], and usually
let [sway][sway] manage windows for me. I'm trying something called
[Zen][zenbrowser] to browse the net, or sometimes [Orion][orion], or
[Chromium][chromium] because Chrome is the web, don't you know? Ah well,
another thing that sucks.

I write in [Neovim][nvim], store passwords with [Bitwarden][bitwarden],
and synchronize files between various devices using a combination of
[Syncthing][syncthing] and [git-annex][gitannex]. [Musicpd][mpd] is
probably playing music close by, if Spotify isn't.


I don't identify with a specific branch of the developer or sysadmin
trees, but I enjoy these programming languages: [Go][golang],
[Rust][rust], [Ruby][ruby] and also [Haskell][haskell]. I'm always
looking for excuses to play with other languages, more so if they try
to change how I think of programming. Lately: Gleam, Zig, Typescript,
Racket, etc. ðŸ¤“

# Photography

I have been into photography for years, as a private hobby mostly. I
believe that the best camera is often the one you got with you. When
possible, I like less magic than what a smartphone provides though.

I'm usually shooting with:

- a [Ricoh GRIIIx][ricoh-gr3x], because it's incredibly powerful for
such a small thing.
- a [Leica M6 TTL][m6], with 35mm and 55mm lenses, and recently
- trying a [Rollei 35 AF][rollei35af], and of course
- an iPhone when all else fails.

It's fun to realize that I've gone from carrying huge DSLRs, like
Canon's 5Ds, to much much smaller stuff. My back is happier at least.

# About this website

I have never been very good at maintaining websites.  However, as I
sometimes feel the need to write (sorry about that), I once decided that
keeping an online repository would help.  Of course it does not: it has
been fun (and time-consuming) when I had the leisure to roll my own
software for the task, and boring at best when I tried to use other
people's soup.

So, I guess that this is the N-th attempt, using a great piece of
software named [hakyll][hakyll] which sits on the fine line between
*DIY* and *not my business*.

Finally, this site helps me a lot to keep in touch with family and
friends. As I live away from most of them for months at a time, and not
all can afford to travel to Mexico, France, or wherever we are.


# Still reading?

I have many projects related to my interests. One of these is to
own all the data I produce voluntarily online, in order to make it
available under this domain first-hand, before federating to various
services. However, time is not my friend, and you'll find me on various
centralized online services:

 * I share code on [my little git server][forge] but also [on Github][github],
 * I [toot][fediverse],
 * and (used to) publish pictures, mostly [on Flickr][flickr].

That decentralization thing is ongoing ; we'll see where it leads in a
few years.
