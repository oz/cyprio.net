# About this website

I have never been very good at maintaining websites.  However, as I
sometimes feel the need to write (sorry about that), I once decided that
keeping an online repository would help.  Of course it does not: it has
been fun (and time-consuming) when I had the leisure to roll my own
software for the task, and boring at best when I tried to use other
people's soup.

So, I guess that this is the N-th attempt, using a great piece of
software named [hakyll][hakyll] which sits on the fine line between
*DIY* and *not my business*.

Finally, this site helps me a lot to keep in touch with family and
friends. As I live away from most of them for months at a time, and not
all can afford to travel to Mexico, France, or wherever we are.

# About the author

I'm a French guy, sharing my life between France and Mexico with my
[wife][karina] and kid. Currently I am in: _Oaxaca, Mexico_.

I have been selling my services as a software engineer for some years
now, that means [I understand how everything went so
wrong](https://xkcd.com/1760/), not necessarily how to fix it. I can't
stop making things with computers and that's how I spend most of my
time.

I work remotely, but I can assure you that I like to meet people. :)


## Computers

Curiosity is the main reason I'm into computers, and also a sense of
practicality: I like to (re-)program things around me to do whatever I
want. This is sadly less and less permitted by hardware and software
vendors, and so requires more patience and skills than it should, but we
can still have tons of fun.

### I'm using this

My main computer is a small [Dell XPS 13][xps13], it's running
[Archlinux][archlinux] which I have no strong feelings about. I'd
probably run some flavor of [BSD][freebsd], if my dayjob didn't require
Linux, containers and what not.

I spend most of my time in terminals running [tmux][tmux], and let
[i3][i3] manage windows for me. I use both [Firefox][firefox] and
[Chromium][chromium] because Chrome is eating the web. I store passwords
with [Bitwarden][bitwarden], and synchronize files between various
devices using a combination of [Syncthing][syncthing] and
[git-annex][gitannex]. [Musicpd][mpd] is probably playing music close
by.

Daily, I'm editing text from [Neovim][nvim], or [Emacs][emacs]. I'm some
kind of a polyglot developer with a taste for [Ruby][ruby],
[Go][golang], and sometimes [Haskell][haskell]. I'm always looking for
excuses to play with other languages, more so if they try to change how
I think of programming. Lately: Rust, Nim, Zig, Elixir, Gleam, (...) all
interesting. :)

I have to mention that I have zero loyalty for phones, and have run
Nokia's Maemo, Plam's webOS, Apple's iOS, Jolla's SailfishOS, and lately
Google's Android. They all suck.

## Photography

I have been into photography on and off for years.

A few years ago, I got a small [Leica D-Lux][dlux], and experimented
for a while until I decided I actually wanted a camera. So I upgraded
to a fat [Canon 5D][5d] (mark 2 at the time) which kept me busy for
years with its billions megapixels, until I sold it. Canon makes great
DSLRs and some excellent lenses, but I wanted [lighter and less flashy
gear][xt1]. I also did not need that much megapixels.

Meanwhile I had been playing with borrowed [Holga][holga] and
[Diana][diana] cameras ; however terrible tools they were in my hands,
the film process was a fun distraction. I was hooked. I got myself the
little [Lomo LCA+][lomo], and carried it everywhere, happily snapping
without thinking of how I was engaging my four [Instagram][instagram]
followers.

Film, surprisingly, refuses to die. I am thankful for this.

In the end, I found a [Leica M6][m6] in really good shape on e-bay,
bought 35mm and 50mm lenses for it, and started to think a little
before I take a picture. These days I always carry the Leica and Fuji
in [my little camera bag][onabags], and seem to have quenched my Gear
Acquisition Syndrome.

I am by no mean a professional or an artist, but photography is a good
way for me to get me out of my comfort zone. It has allowed me to meet
incredible people. Finally, shooting film rather than only digital is
part of a collection of details and setups that make my brain happier.
Which is a good reason to keep using film as long as they sell it.

I have many projects related to my interests. One of these is to
own all the data I produce voluntarily online, in order to make it
available under this domain first-hand, before federating to various
services. However, time is not my friend, and you'll find me on various
centralized online services:

 * I share code [on Github][github],
 * I [tweet][twitter],
 * and publish pictures, mostly [on Flickr][flickr].
