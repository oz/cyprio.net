# About this website

I have never been very good at maintaining websites.  However, as I sometimes
feel the need to write (sorry about that), I once decided that keeping an
online repository would help.  Of course it does not: it has been fun (and
time-consuming) when I had the leisure to roll my own software for the task,
and boring at best when I tried to use other people's soup.

So, I guess that this is the N-th attempt, using a fine piece of software named
[hakyll][hakyll] which sits on the line between *DIY* and *not my business*.

Finally, this site helps me a lot to keep in touch with family and friends. As
I have been living away from most of them for quite a while, and not all can
afford to travel to Mexico.

# About the author

I'm a French guy, currently living in the South of Mexico (the north of the
country looks too dangerous for my taste) with my [wife][karina].  I've been
employed as a programmer or software engineer for a few years now, and I can't
seem to stop.  I guess this grants me the *geeky* tag, I don't really care
about it.

I have been working from home, and local *cafés* for a few years now.  If you
asked, I would probably say that I'm not attached to it. But remote work
provides so much liberty and flexibility that I'm embarrassed, and concerned
when great people are *forced* into noisy open-space offices.  The guys at
37signals wrote [an excellent book][remote] on the topic that you *must* read.

## Computers

Curiosity is the main reason I'm into computers, and also a sense of
practicality: I like to (re-)program things around me to do whatever I want.
This is sadly less and less permitted by hardware and software vendors, and so
requires more patience and skills than it should.

### I'm using this

I'm mainly using two laptops. First a [Lenovo X220][x220] that's been with me
since it was released, running [Debian][debian] ever since. I'm spend most of
my time in [Urxvt][urxvt] terminals running [tmux][tmux], and let
[Xmonad][xmonad] manage windows for me.  I use [Firefox][firefox] for browsing,
and [Chromium][chromium] for web development. I store my passwords in
[KeepassX][keepass], and synchronize files between various disks using
a combination of [Bittorrent Sync][btsync] and [git-annex][gitannex].

Daily, I'm editing code in [VIM][vim] using a combination of [Ruby][ruby],
[Javascript][node], [Go][golang], and [Haskell][haskell]... I'd also like to
know [Rust][rust] and [Elixir][elixir] better... The thing is that yes, I'm
probably interested in your new programming language.

From time to time, I can bear to use macs. So for work, I carry an 11" [Macbook
Air][mba] which I love for its weight, size, and hardware, but hate for its
software and stupid keyboard layout. Adobe's [Lightroom][lightroom] doesn't run
(yet?) on Linux, so Apple is getting my money here. Steve also sold me an
[iPhone 4S][iphone_4s] that I can't seem to replace because: it's not dead yet,
and I don't want a bigger screen.

## Photography

I have been into photography on and off for years. A few years ago, I got a
small [Leica D-Lux][dlux], and experimented for a while until I decided I
needed more serious gear. So I upgraded to a fat [Canon 5D][5d] (mark 2 at the
time) which has kept me busy since. Canon makes great DSLRs and their prime
lenses are excellent.  But this does not end here...

I had been playing with borrowed [Holga][holga] and [Diana][diana] cameras,
when I decided that they were horribly bad for me. But film was a fun
distraction, I was bit and I got myself the little [Lomo LCA+][lomo] that I now
carry everywhere. Lastly, I found a [Leica M6][m6] in really good shape on
e-bay, and bought a 35mm lens for it.  I always carry those two in my camera
bag, and I hope to have quenched my Gear Acquisition Syndrome for some years.

I am by no mean a professional nor an artist, but photography has proven a very
good way to get me out of my comfort zone, and has allowed me to meet
incredible people around the world.  Finally, shooting film rather than only
digital is part of a collection of details and setups that make my brain
happier.  Which is a good reason to keep using film as long as they sell it.

I am not a photo geek either, but I enjoy these guys' works: Alfred Stieglitz,
Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Manuel Álvarez Bravo, Daidō Moriyama, Josef
Koudelka, etc. Have a look!

# Still reading?

I have many projects related to my interests. One of these is to own all the
data I produce voluntarily online, in order to make it available under this
domain first-hand, before federating to various services. However, time is not
my friend, and you'll find me on various centralized online services:

 * I share code [on Github][github],
 * I [tweet][twitter],
 * and publish pictures, mostly [on Flickr][flickr].
