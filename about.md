# Well, what about this place?

I have never been very good at maintaining websites, but since I do feel
the urge to write sometimes (sorry about that), I have no other choice
than to keep this website online.

Furthermore, this site helps me a lot to keep in touch with family and
friends.  As I have been living away from most of them for quite a
while, and not all can afford to travel to Mexico.

As a side note, I want to ensure you that no animals were harmed in the
making of this website.

# The author

Now that I made clear that most of the content is not interesting to the
general public but a select few, here are a few notes on myself, and the
various online places where I can be found.

 * I tweet as [ephoz][twitter],
 * I archive and publish some pictures on Flickr, as [ephoz][flickr],
 * and I push code on Github as [github][github].
