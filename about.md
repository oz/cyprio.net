# About this website

I have never been very good at maintaining websites.  However, as I sometimes
feel the need to write (sorry about that), I once decided that keeping an
online repository would help.  Of course it does not: it has been fun (and
time-consuming) when I had the leisure to roll my own software for the task,
and boring at best when I tried to use other people's soup.

So, I guess that this is the N-th attempt, using a great piece of software
named [hakyll][hakyll] which sits on the fine line between *DIY* and *not my
business*.

Finally, this site helps me a lot to keep in touch with family and friends. As
I have been living away from most of them for quite a while, and not all can
afford to travel to Mexico, France, or wherever we are.

# About the author

I'm a French guy, sharing my life between France and Mexico with my
[wife][karina] and kid. Currently I am in: _Paris, France_.

I have been selling my services as a software engineer for some years now, that
means [I understand how everything went so wrong](https://xkcd.com/1760/). I
can't stop making things with computers, that is my passion: as such, if you
need help fixing a program, website, or cluster of connected rice cookers, you
could hire me.

I work remotely, but I can assure you that I like to meet people. :)


## Computers

Curiosity is the main reason I'm into computers, and also a sense of
practicality: I like to (re-)program things around me to do whatever I
want. This is sadly less and less permitted by hardware and software
vendors, and so requires more patience and skills than it should, but we
can still have tons of fun.

### I'm using this

My main computer is an old [Lenovo X220][x220], that has been with me
since its release date sometime in 2010 or 2011. It has been running
[Debian][debian], [Freebsd][freebsd], and lately [Archlinux][archlinux].
These tend to just work on this particular laptop, I'm not going to
evangelize any of it to you but running a free _libre_ OS is better for
(y)our freedom.

I spend most of my time in terminals running [tmux][tmux], and let
[i3][i3] manage windows for me. I use [Firefox][firefox] for browsing,
and [Chromium][chromium] for web development. I store passwords in a
[KeepassX][keepass] safe, and synchronize files between various devices
using a combination of [Syncthing][syncthing] and [git-annex][gitannex].
[Musicpd][mpd] is probably playing music close by.

Daily, I'm editing code from [Neovim][nvim], [Emacs][emacs], or even
[Atom][atom] (I know!): [Ruby][ruby], [Javascript][node], [Go][golang], and
[Haskell][haskell] are my favorite hammers. I'm always looking for an excuse to
play more with [Rust][rust], [Elixir][elixir], or even [Crystal][crystal]...
The thing is that, as long as it introduces new programming concepts, I'm
probably interested in your new language.

From time to time, I have to use macs. Mostly because Adobe's
[Lightroom][lightroom] doesn't run (yet?) on Linux, so Apple is getting some of
my money here.

I have to mention that I have zero loyalty for phones, and have run Nokia's
Maemo, Plam's webOS, Apple's iOS, Jolla's SailfishOS, and lately Google's
Android. They all suck.

## Photography

I have been into photography on and off for years.

A few years ago, I got a small [Leica D-Lux][dlux], and experimented
for a while until I decided I actually wanted a camera. So I upgraded
to a fat [Canon 5D][5d] (mark 2 at the time) which kept me busy for
years with its billions megapixels, until I sold it. Canon makes great
DSLRs and some excellent lenses, but I wanted [lighter and less flashy
gear][xt1]. I also did not need that much megapixels.

Meanwhile I had been playing with borrowed [Holga][holga] and
[Diana][diana] cameras ; however terrible tools they were in my hands,
the film process was a fun distraction. I was hooked. I got myself the
little [Lomo LCA+][lomo], and carried it everywhere, happily snapping
without thinking of how I was engaging my four [Instagram][instagram]
followers.

Film, surprisingly, refuses to die. I am thankful for this.

In the end, I found a [Leica M6][m6] in really good shape on e-bay,
bought 35mm and 50mm lenses for it, and started to think a little
before I take a picture. These days I always carry the Leica and Fuji
in [my little camera bag][onabags], and seem to have quenched my Gear
Acquisition Syndrome.

I am by no mean a professional or an artist, but photography is a good
way for me to get me out of my comfort zone. It has allowed me to meet
incredible people. Finally, shooting film rather than only digital is
part of a collection of details and setups that make my brain happier.
Which is a good reason to keep using film as long as they sell it.

I have many projects related to my interests. One of these is to
own all the data I produce voluntarily online, in order to make it
available under this domain first-hand, before federating to various
services. However, time is not my friend, and you'll find me on various
centralized online services:

 * I share code [on Github][github],
 * I [tweet][twitter],
 * and publish pictures, mostly [on Flickr][flickr].
