<p>Welcome to this website. My name is <a href="./about.html">Arnaud
Berthomier</a>, and this domain is mainly used as my online notebook. As a
consequence, I try to maintain this website with very little fuss and effort ;
while all content is not available to <em>every</em> search engine, feel free
to have a look around.</p>

<h1>wtf?</h1>

<p>You will find here some rants I've been publishing for a few years for
friends (and at times family):</p>

$partial("templates/wtf/post-list.html")$

<p>â€¦or you can find more in the <a href="./wtf">archives</a>.
